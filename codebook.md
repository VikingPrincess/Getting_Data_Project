## This is the code book for all the variables used in Getting and cleaning data Project
### Step by step through instructions:

* tmp1 and tmp2 - auxilliary tables used just to temporarily hold the data to be merged
as training and test set.
* m_o_i - "measures of interest", used in step 2 to extract only the mean and stdev for each measurement.
* activities - a temporary holder for activity labels, just until the names of activities are "beautified".
* uniqueSubjects, numSubjects,numActivities, numCols, all integer, used to pick out the means of each variable 
  through each activity and each unique subject.
